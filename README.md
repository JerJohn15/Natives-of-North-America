Natives-of-North-America
========================

A complete mapstory of the native peoples of North America

Introduction:
While we have plenty of maps of how the landscape of North America was colonized and settled by Europeans and their offshoots, we have very little of what the native landscape looked like at any time. The goal of this project is to create the first openly available, comprehensive map of native peoples, while expanding it into a mapstory that shows how they changed over time, as far back as there are written and archaeological records. This will be merged into MapStory Local, an effort to create a single mapstory of the history of human settlement.

Notes on the first release:
The map that was first released on Sept 3, 2014 was traced from a magnificent National Geographic map from 1999 (which was updated from a map created in 1972), with consultation of William C. Sturtevant, who was the chief editor of the Handbook of North American Indians, an incredible magnum opus of every native people in North America. The original map is based largely on the maps that exist throughout the Handbook. The map was georeferenced, traced as close to verbatim as possible, and then styled with tilemill and uploaded to a MapBox account. It is my hope that National Geographic and publishers of the Handbook will embrace this project, as it will build on the fantastic work they have done and provide the basis for much more accurate maps to be used in the future. What we will do here is going to be digital, and I hope that National Geographic will use it to create more beautiful maps of native peoples in the future.
The map is not meant to be precise, and it is only roughly accurate. There are no overlapping territories, all land areas are assigned to a people, and it shows the generalized location of groups when they were encountered by Europeans, according to the records that had been gathered at the time the map was published in 1999. Part of my motivation of presenting this way is to show the groups like how sovereign states are depicted on maps today. The rights to land were of course regarded very differently by native peoples than the nation-state system that is ubiquitous today.

What needs to be done next:
*First off, this is my first experience with GitHub, and I have almost no understanding of code. My current knowledge amounts to copy-pasting code that I know works and changing values. I have little technical knowledge in general. Help will be appreciated.
*Map may need to be on a dedicated server; it's probable that mapbox is going to get really expensive really fast, and we will need to add more features and allow people to zoom in further. If someone can do that and then help me migrate the site, that would be awesome.
*I don't want to sustain this project with ads. If anyone can help pay for this, that would be great.
*Opacity slider needs to work on mobile devices. Apparently this feature is not available in MapBox. We may need to move ou
